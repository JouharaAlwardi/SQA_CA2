## Task1: Scrum sprint backlog and task estimation

The following table demonstrates a prioritised Sprint backlog of tasks, with estimates for each task:

Priority | Backlog  | Owner | Estimate (Hours) | Status
------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------
1   | Create a new project repository  | Jouhara Alwardi | .05 | Completed |
2   | Integrating github with eclipse  | Jouhara Alwardi | .07 | Completed |
3   | Generate branches for each task  | Jouhara Alwardi | .1 | Completed |
4   | Identify required functions  | Jouhara Alwardi | .5 | Completed |
5   | Recognizing object relationships | Jouhara Alwardi | 1.0 | Completed |
6   | Creating & writing object classes | Jouhara Alwardi | 4.0 | Completed |
7   | Creating & writing  main Classes | Jouhara Alwardi | 6.0 | Completed |
8   | Building unit tests | Jouhara Alwardi | 3.0  | Completed |
9   | Code-review checklist | Jouhara Alwardi | .4  | Completed |

 **Choosing Estimates:** The previous estimates demonstrates the amount of time it would require me to complete the tasks fully. I've minimised the required time to accomplish  easier tasks as it would give me more time to focus on other complex tasks in the sprint backlog. Also, prioritising complex tasks with longer estimates helps me focus on solving the problem to the core, minimise duplicated code in my system and find any small error mistakes. I've also decided to estimate in hours because:

 1. Estimating in hours is feasible because it contains fewer items, which means it wonâ€™t take as long
 2. Can be performed by one person
 3. It's an abstract measure with many strengths


 **The reasoning behind the estimates (Comparison):** The above estimates  represent a relative value to the degree of effort required to complete each task listed in the previous sprint backlog. Tasks such as "Creating & writing object classes" will take longer hours as they require complex technical solutions with possible risks of technical errors, due to the complexity of the relationships between each object in the project. On the contrary, Tasks such as "Integrating github with eclipse" require shorter estimates, as risk and uncertainty factors are less likely to occur. Consequently, shorter estimates provide additional extra time to:

 1. Refractor the code 
 2. Add extra validations to the system
 3. Go back to the sprint backlog to make sure all tasks are fully completed


  **Velocity Metric:** Velocity is the key metric in Scrum, measures the required amount of work a team can tackle during a sprint. At the end of each sprint, velocity is calculated by totaling the points for all fully completed user stories. For example, if we have 5 user stories with a total of 25 points, by the end of the iterations only two are completed, with a total of 10 points. Such calculations will be saved and reviewed in the beginning of the next sprint. Sprint planning event is usually scheduled on the first day of a new sprint, the event starts by reviewing calculations and tasks from the previous sprint.
